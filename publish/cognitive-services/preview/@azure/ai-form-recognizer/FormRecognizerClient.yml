      Recognizes data from business cards using a pre-built business card model,

      This method returns a long running operation poller that allows you to

      Note that the onProgress callback will not be invoked if the operation
      completes in the first

      request, and attempting to cancel a completed copy will result in an error
      being thrown.


      Example usage:

      enabling you to extract structure data

      from receipts such as merchant name, merchant phone number, transaction
      date, and more.

      For a list of fields that are contained in the response, please refer to
      the documentation at the

      following link: https://aka.ms/azsdk/formrecognizer/receiptfields


      This method returns a long running operation poller that allows you to
      wait

      indefinitely until the operation is completed.


      Note that the onProgress callback will not be invoked if the operation
      completes in the first

      request, and attempting to cancel a completed copy will result in an error
      being thrown.


      Example usage:

      ```ts

      const url = "<url to the receipt document>";

      const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new
      AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));

      const poller = await client.beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl(url, {
        includeFieldElements: true,
        onProgress: (state) => {
          console.log(`analyzing status: ${state.status}`);
        }
      });

      const [receipt] = await poller.pollUntilDone();

      ```

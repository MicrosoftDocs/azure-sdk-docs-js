summary: >-
  Ranking function based on the Okapi BM25 similarity algorithm. BM25 is a
  TF-IDF-like algorithm

  that includes length normalization (controlled by the 'b' parameter) as well
  as term frequency

  saturation (controlled by the 'k1' parameter).

      This property controls how the length of a document affects the relevance
      score. By default, a

      value of 0.75 is used. A value of 0.0 means no length normalization is
      applied, while a value

      of 1.0 means the score is fully normalized by the length of the document.

    summary: >-
      This property controls the scaling function between the term frequency of
      each matching terms

      and the final relevance score of a document-query pair. By default, a
      value of 1.2 is used. A

      value of 0.0 means the score does not scale with an increase in term
      frequency.

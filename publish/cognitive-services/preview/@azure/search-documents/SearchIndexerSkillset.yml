    summary: >-
      A description of an encryption key that you create in Azure Key Vault.
      This key is used to

      provide an additional level of encryption-at-rest for your skillset
      definition when you want

      full assurance that no one, not even Microsoft, can decrypt your skillset
      definition in Azure

      Cognitive Search. Once you have encrypted your skillset definition, it
      will always remain

      encrypted. Azure Cognitive Search will ignore attempts to set this
      property to null. You can

      change this property as needed if you want to rotate your encryption key;
      Your skillset

      definition will be unaffected. Encryption with customer-managed keys is
      not available for free

      search services, and is only available for paid services created on or
      after January 1, 2019.

  The SessionReceiver class can be used to receive messages from a session
  enabled Queue or

  Subscription in a batch or by registering handlers.

  Use the `createReceiver` function on the QueueClient or SubscriptionClient to
  instantiate a

  SessionReceiver.

  The SessionReceiver class is an abstraction over the underlying AMQP receiver
  link.
